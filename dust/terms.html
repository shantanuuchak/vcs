                the customer: 'we', 'us' or 'our' means the contractor named on
                the front of this contract. These Conditions can only be Changed
                or amended by our written agreement. If you pay our charges,
                including the insurance premium (if necessary) shown on our
                account, then while your HOUSEHOLD GOODS and PERSONAL EFFECTS
                are in our care, for the purposes of removals and or storage,
                they will be insured against ALL RISKS including the risk of
                Fire when in store on an Indemnity basis subject to the
                conditions and exceptions below for the amount of their full
                value in like condition and similar age as declare by you to us

                value, we will only arrange cover on your goods for up to Rs.
                1,00,000. An additional premium may be required if you declare a
                high value.
